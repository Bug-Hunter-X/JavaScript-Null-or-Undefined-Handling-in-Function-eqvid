# JavaScript Null or Undefined Handling in Function

This repository demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript: handling `null` or `undefined` values within functions.  Improper handling of these values can lead to unexpected results or runtime errors.

## The Problem

The provided `foo` function is designed to add two numbers. However, it lacks robust handling of `null` or `undefined` inputs. This can cause errors or return unexpected results.

## The Solution

The solution file (`bugSolution.js`) provides a more robust implementation that includes explicit checks for `null` or `undefined` values before performing the addition. This prevents errors and ensures consistent behavior.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in a JavaScript environment (e.g., a browser's console or Node.js).
3. Run the code to see the difference in output.
